‚ú® Key Features

üìÑ Multi-Format Document Processor: Seamlessly upload and process .pdf, .docx, and .txt files.

üß† AI-Powered Summarizer: Distills lengthy documents into concise, well-structured summaries, highlighting key terms and concepts using Llama 3.

üí¨ Conversational Q&A (Chat with your Docs): Ask questions in natural language and receive context-aware answers sourced directly from your documents.

üéôÔ∏è Dual-Voice Podcast Generator: Automatically transforms your content into an engaging, two-host podcast script and generates the corresponding audio file.

‚ö° Blazing Fast & Responsive: Built with the high-performance Groq API for near-instantaneous LLM responses and a sleek, modern UI created with Streamlit.

üèõÔ∏è Architecture & How It Works

Document Genie is built on a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. This approach enhances the Large Language Model's capabilities by providing it with relevant, external information sourced directly from your documents.

Here's a breakdown of the workflow:

Generated mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "1. Document Ingestion & Processing"
        A[User Uploads Files <br> (.pdf, .docx, .txt)] --> B{Load & Chunk Documents};
        B --> C[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter];
    end

    subgraph "2. Indexing: Creating the Knowledge Base"
        C --> D{Generate Embeddings <br> (Hugging Face 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2')};
        D --> E[Store in FAISS Vector Store <br> (In-Memory)];
    end

    subgraph "3. RAG Pipeline: Chat & Q&A"
        F[User Asks a Question] --> G{FAISS Retriever};
        G -- Fetches Relevant Chunks --> H{LangChain Stuff Chain};
        E -- Provides Context --> G;
        I[Groq Llama 3 LLM] --> H;
        H -- Injects Context into Prompt --> I;
        I --> J[Generated Answer];
    end

    subgraph "4. Advanced Content Generation"
        K[User requests Summary or Podcast] --> L{LangChain Prompt Engineering};
        L -- Creative Prompt --> M[Groq Llama 3 LLM];
        M --> N[Generates Summary / Podcast Script];
        N --> O{gTTS Voice Synthesis};
        O --> P[Dual-Voice MP3 Audio];
    end

Ingestion & Chunking: Uploaded documents are loaded and broken down into smaller, manageable chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.

Embedding & Indexing: Each chunk is converted into a numerical vector (an embedding) using a Hugging Face model. These vectors are stored in a FAISS vector store, creating a searchable knowledge base.

Retrieval: When you ask a question, the FAISS retriever scans the vector store to find the document chunks most relevant to your query.

Generation: The retrieved chunks are injected as context into a prompt, which is then sent to the Llama 3 8B model via the Groq API. This allows the LLM to generate a highly accurate and context-aware answer, summary, or podcast script.

Voice Synthesis: For podcasts, the generated script is parsed to identify two speakers ('Alex' and 'Ben'). The gTTS library then synthesizes the dialogue using different top-level domains (co.uk and .com) to simulate distinct voices.

üìñ Usage Guide

Upload Documents: Use the sidebar to upload one or more files (.pdf, .docx, .txt).

Process Documents: Click the Process Documents button. This will create the vector store needed for all other features.

Generate a Summary: Navigate to the üìÑ Summarizer tab and click Generate Summary.

Chat with Docs: Go to the üí¨ Chat with Docs tab, type your question into the input box, and press Enter.

Create a Podcast:

In the üéôÔ∏è Podcast Generator tab, first click Generate Podcast Script.

Once the script appears, click üîä Generate Audio to synthesize the MP3 file. You can then listen to it directly or download it.
